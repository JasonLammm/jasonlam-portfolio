I am a final-year Computer Science student at CUHK (cGPA: 3.202/4.000, tGPA: 3.494/4.000) with a focus on full-stack web development, AI-powered systems, and game development.
I enjoy building practical, user-focused applications—from university course planning tools and mobile apps to AI-driven exam systems and educational games.
